# IPFSbin
***
A pastebin based on IPFS. It is a 100% static website running on JavaScript and HTML.

Basically:

2. You get the hash
3. You pin it. The save modal give you instructions on how to pin it.

To be added: 
- A simple button to pin directly to [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud) with it's API.
